# Word Cloud

A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud or word or weighted list, is a visual representation of text data where words are displayed in different sizes and colors.

```jsx live noInline
const data = mdwd.wordCloud;
const options = {
  colorMode: 'random', // one of random, repeat, lighten, darken
};
render(
  <mdw-chart
    style={{ height: '500px' }}
    type="wordCloud"
    data={JSON.stringify(data)}
    options={JSON.stringify(options)}
  ></mdw-chart>,
);
```

## Data

You can pass the data as following formats. The both of them are supported.

```json
[{key: "word", value: 110}, {key: "words", value: 90}, ...]
```

```json
{ "word": 100, "words": 90, ... }
```
