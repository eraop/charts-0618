# Data from URL

We do not provide any HTTP clients for you. So you need to set it before starting using this function.

## Set HTTP Client

We will use the Fetch and Axios as the examples to show you how to start.

### Fetch

[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) provides an interface for fetching resources (such as JSON, HTML, or images) asynchronously across the network.
It's built into modern web browsers and allows you to make HTTP requests to servers and handle responses using promises.

```javascript
mdw.settings.setHttpClient(new function () {
  this.get = function (url) {
    return fetch(url).then((response) => {
      return response.json();
    });
  }
});
```

### Axios

The following code example will show you how to set it with popular HTTP client library([Axios](https://axios-http.com/)).
If you are using TypeScript as the programming language, we recommend to implement the interface [Http](/docs/api/interfaces/Http).

```javascript
mdw.settings.setHttpClient(
  new function () {
    const endpoint = 'http://localhost:3000';
    this.get = function (url) {
      return axios.get(endpoint + url).then((response) => {
        return response.data;
      });
    };
  }(),
);
```

## Set URL

Then you can set the attribute **data-url** for getting data from your backend APIs as below.

```jsx live noInline
render(
  <mdw-chart
    type="line"
    data-url="https://momentum-design.github.io/momentum-widgets/data.json#line"
    options='{"categoryAxis":{"dataKey":"date","type":"time","labelFormat":"MMM D"}}'
  ></mdw-chart>,
);
```
